The max function introduces non-linearity element wise thresholding at 0. $W_2$ then would be 10x100 and we get 10 class scores. Non-linearity is crucial-if we left it out, the two matrices could be collapsed into 1, and the class scores would just be a linear function of the input.

If the local gradient is very small, it will kill the gradient and almost no signal will flow through the neuron to its weights and to its data. You have to be careful initializing the weights of sigmoid to prevent saturation, if too large then most neurons will become saturated and the NN won't learn. \n",

NN's work well in practice because they express nice smooth functions that fit well with statistical properties of data we encounter, and are easy to learn using optimization algorithms. Deeper nets work better than single hidden layer nets is an empirical observation, despite the fact their representational power is equal. Often the case 3 > 2 layers but deeper rarely helps. Unlike CNNs where going deeper works. One argument is that images contain hierarchical structure so several layers of processing makes sense. \n",

        "\n",
        "Although it can express more complexity it leads to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model with high capacity fits the noise in the data instead of the underlying relationship. In the above the 20 hidden neurons fit all training data points but it segments the space into many disjoint decision regions. Conversly, the 3 hidden model lacks representational power. This models the data as two blobs and interprets a few outliers (noise) in the green blob which may lead to better generalization on the test set. \n",
        "\n",
        "Smaller nets may appear better but it is almost always better to overfit and regularize. The reason being that the smaller nets are harder to train with local methods such as gradient descent: it's clear their loss functions have few local minima, but that many of these minima are easier to converge to, and they are bad (with high loss). Conversly, bigger nets contain more local minima but they have much better loss. Since NN are non-convex it's hard to study these properties mathematically. In practice, you find that if you train a small net the final loss can display a good amount of variance. If you train a large net you'll start to find many different solutions, but the variance in the final achieved loss will be much smaller. \n",

        "Several methods for controlling overfitting:\n",
        "\n",
        "**L2 Regularisation** penalisez the squared magnitude of all parameters directly in the objective. For every weight $w$, we add the term $\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda w^2$ to the objective where $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength. It is common to see the factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ in front because the gradient of this term w.r.t the parameter $w$ is simply $\\lambda w$ instead of $2 \\lambda w$. The L2 regularisaiton has the intuitive interpretation of heavily penalizing peaky weight vectors and preferring diffuse weight vectors. This has the effect of encouraging the network to use all of its inputs rather than some of its inputs a lot. Lastly, during gradient descent parameter update, using L2 means that every weight is decayed linearly: ``` W += - lambda * W ``` towards zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "**L1 Regularisation** is another common form, where for each weight $w$ we add the term $\\lambda |w|$ to the objective. You can combine L1 and L2: $\\lambda_1 |w| + \\lambda_2 w^2$ (this is called Elastic net regularisation). L1 has the property of leading weight vectors to become sparse during optimisation ( i.e. close to 0). In other words, neurons with L1 end up using only a sparse subset of their most important inputs and become nearly invariant to noisy inputs. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Max norm constraints**. Another form is to enforce an absolute upper bound on the magnitude of the weight vector for every neuron and use projected gradient descent to enforce the constraint. This corresponds to performing the parameter update as normal, then enforcing the constraint by clamping the weight vector $\\overrightarrow{w}$ of every neuron to satisfy $||\\overrightarrow{w}||_2 < c$. Typical values of $c$ are on orders of 3 or 4. One of this methods appealing properties is that the network cannot explode when learning rates are set too high because the updates are bound.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dropout** is extremely effective and simple that complements other methods L1, L2, maxnorm. While training, dropout is implemented by keeping a neuron active with some probability $p$ or setting them to inactive. It can be interpreted as sampling a NN within a full NN and only updating the parameters of the sampled network based on the input data. Dropout is not applied at test with the interpretation of evaluating an averaged prediction across the exponentially-sized ensemble of all sub-networks. \n",

With dropout the expected output from this neuron will become $px + (1-p)0$, because the neuron's output will be set to zero with probability $1-p$. At test, we keep the neuron always active, we must adjust $x \\rightarrow px$ to keep the same expected output. Scaling at test time is not preferable so we prefer to use inverted dropout, which performs the scaling at train time, leaving the forward pass untouched. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Theme of noise in forward pass**. Dropout falls into a more general category of methods that introduce stochastic behavior in the forward pass of the net. During test, noise is marginalized over analytically (as is the case with dropout when multiplying by $p$), or numerically (e.g. via sampling, by performing several forward passes with different random decisions and then averaging over them). Another similar method is DropConnect where random sets of weights are set to zero (dropping the connections). CNN's also take advantage of this theme with methods such as stochastic pooling, fractional pooling and data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bias regularization**. It is not common to regularize the bias since it does not interact with the data multiplicatively, and doesn't control the influence of data on the final objective like the weights. This often improves results since the classifier can afford to use the biases if it needs them to obtain a better data loss. \n",

        "\n",
        "The second part of an objective is the data loss, which in supervised learning measure the compatibility between a prediction and ground truth. The data loss takes the form of an average over the data losses for every individual example. That is, $L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i L_i$ where N is the number of training data. Lets abbreviate $f = f(x_i;W)$ to be the activations of the output layer. There are several problems you want to solve in practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classification**. Let's assume a dataset of examples and a single correct label. One of two most common cost functions is SVM e.g. the Weston Watkins formulation: \n",
        "\n",
        "$L_i = \\sum_{j\\neq y_i} \\max(0, f_j - f_{y_i} + 1)$ \n",
        "\n",
        "The squared hing loss is the same but with a squared term $\\max(0, f_j - f_{y_i} + 1)^2$. The second common choice is the Softmax classifier that uses cross-entropy loss:\n",
        "\n",
        "$L_i = -\\log\\left(\\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{ \\sum_j e^{f_j} }\\right)$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem: Large number of classes**. When the set of classes is very large, it may be helpful to use *Hierarchical Softmax*. This decomposes labels into a tree. Each label is then represented as a path along the tree, and a softmax classifier is trained at every node of the tree to disambiguate between left and right branch. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Attribute classification**. Both lossess assume there is a single correct answer, but what is $y_i$ is a binary vector where every example may or may not have a certain attribute, and where attributes are not exclusive? For example, images on Instagram can be thought of as labeled with a certain subset of hashtags from a large set of all hashtags, and an image may contain multiple. An approach to this is to build a binary classifier for every single attribute independently. For example, a binary classifier for each category independently would take the form: \n",
        "\n",
        "$L_i = \\sum_j \\max(0, 1 - y_{ij} f_j)$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the sum is over all categories $j$ and $y_{ij}$ is either +1 or -1 depending on whether the i-th example is labeled with the j-th attribute and the score vector $f_j$ will be positive when the class is predicted to be present and negative otherwise. The loss is accumulated if a positive example has a score less than +1 or when a negative example has a score > -1. \n",
        "\n",
        "An alternative is to train a logistic regression classifier for every attribute independently. A binary logistic regression classifier has only 2 classes (0,1) and calculates a probability of class 1 as: \n",
        "\n",
        "$P(y = 1 \\mid x; w, b) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^Tx +b)}} = \\sigma (w^Tx + b)$\n",

        "Since probabilities of class 1 and 0 sum to one, the probability for class 0 is $P(y = 0 \\mid x; w, b) = 1 - P(y = 1 \\mid x; w,b)$. Hence, an example is classified as a positive example y=1 if $\\sigma (w^Tx + b) > 0.5$ or equivalently if the score $w^Tx +b > 0$. The loss function then maximizes the log likelihood of this probability. This simplifies to: \n",
        "\n",
        "$L_i = \\sum_j y_{ij} \\log(\\sigma(f_j)) + (1 - y_{ij}) \\log(1 - \\sigma(f_j))$\n",

        "where $y_{ij}$ are assumed to be either 1 or 0 and the $\\sigma$ is sigmoid function.The gradient on $f$ is extremely simple and intuitive: $\\partial{L_i} / \\partial{f_j} = y_{ij} - \\sigma(f_j)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Regression** is the task of predicting real-valued quantities. For this is is common to compute the loss between predicted and true answer and measure the L2 squared norm or L1 norm of the difference. L2 norm squared:\n",
        "\n",

        "$L_i = \\Vert f - y_i \\Vert_1 = \\sum_j \\mid f_j - (y_i)_j \\mid$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the sum is over all dimensions of the desired prediction. Looking at the j-th dimension of the i-th example and denoting the difference between the true and predicted value by $\\delta_{ij}$, the gradient for this dimension is easily derived to be either $\\delta_{ij}$ with L2 norm or $sign(\\delta_{ij})$. That is, the gradient on the score will either be directly proportional to the difference in the error or will be fixed and only inherit the sign of the difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "NB: L2 is harder to optimize than softmax. For the softmax precise scores are less important it only matters that their magnitudes are appropriate. Outliers in L2 can bring huge gradients. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Structured prediction**. The structured loss refers to a case where the labels can be arbitrary structures such as graphs, trees. The space of structures is very large. The basic idea behind structured SVM loss is to demand a margin between the correct structure $y_i$ and the highest scoring incorrect structure. Special solvers are devised so that the simplifying assumptions of the structure space can be taken advantage of. \n"

        "\n",
        "It is helpful to anneal the learning rate over time. With a high learning rate, the system has too much kinetic energy and the parameter vector bounces around eratically, unable to settle down. Knowing when to decay the learning rate (lr) can be tricky: Decay it slowly you bounce too much, too fast and you wont converge quickly enough. There are 3 types of lr deacy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step decay**: reduce the lr by some factor every few epochs. \n",
        "- **Exponential decay**. Has the form $\\alpha = \\alpha_0 e^{-k t}$ where $\\alpha_0, k$ are hyperparameters and $t$ is the iteration number. \n",
        "- **1/t decay** has the form $\\alpha = \\alpha_0 / (1 + k t )$ where $\\alpha_0, k$ are hyperparameters and $t$ is the iteration number. \n",

        "Step decay is preferable but there have been advances in this area. \n",

        "Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120. The idea being that large learning rates act as a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization. \n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks\n",
        ": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf . The idea behind cyclical learning rates removes the need for monotonically decreasing the learning rate but setting a \"reasonable boundary\" of values. \n",
        "\n",
        "We start with small lr then increase it linearly or exponentially. To achieve super-convergence a One-cycle policy is used which requires specifying minimum and maximum lr bounds. One cycle involves two step sizes, one in which the lr increases from min to max and decreases from max to min. The intuition behing that the lr starts small to allow convergence to begin but as the net traverses, the lr becomes large allow faster traversal. During the latter stages as we try to reach a local minimum, the lr is reduced. Training with large learning rates acts as a regularizer. \n",

        "\n",
        "Another popular method for optimization is based on Newton's method which iterates the following update: \n",

        "$x \\leftarrow x - [H f(x)]^{-1} \\nabla f(x)$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here $H f(x)$ is the Hessian matrix (which is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives). The term $\\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient vector. The Gessian describes the local curvature of the loss function, which allows us to perform a more efficient updaet. Multiplying by the inverse Hessian leaads the optimization to take more aggressive steps in directions of shallow curvature and shorter steps in directions of steep curvature. This requires no learning rate hyperparameter unlike the first-order methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is impractical since computing and inverting the Hessian is costly. E.g. a NN with 1 million parameters would have a Hessian of 1million x 1million, needing 3725 gigabytes of RAM. \n",

Weigts that receive high gradients have their effective lr reduced, whereas weights with small or infrequent updates have their lr increased. The smoothing term eps avoids division by 0. Often too aggressive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RMSpop**. This adjusts the Adagrad method to reduce aggressiveness, monotonically decreasing the learning rate. It uses a moving average of squared gradients instead:\n",
